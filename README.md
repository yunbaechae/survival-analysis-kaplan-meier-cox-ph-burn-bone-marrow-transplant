# Survival Analysis of Burn and Bone Marrow Transplant Data Using Cox PH and Kaplan-Meier Estimators

ACST3058 Actuarial Modelling Assignment 1 (2023)

This assignment applied Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards model to survival data from burn and bone marrow transplant patients. Focused on survival probability estimation, hazard modelling, and quantitative risk assessment.

## Key Tasks
- Computed Kaplan-Meier survival curves for both datasets  
- Fitted Cox PH model to estimate hazard ratios for covariates  
- Analyzed survival trends and quantitative implications  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier, Cox PH)  
- Hazard ratio estimation and covariate modelling  
- Quantitative risk prediction and validation  

## Submission Details
- The attached PDF is the rendered output from an original R Markdown (.Rmd) document.  
  (Original .Rmd source file is no longer available, but the PDF preserves all survival curves, Cox PH fits, hazard ratios, and quantitative results.)
